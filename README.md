Lipstick
========

Lipstick is a framework for building (mostly Wayland) homescreen applications for
mobile devices. It's based on Qt and QML.

Acknowledgements
================

Lipstick builds heavily on the work of the meegotouchhome and meego-ux-daemon
authors. Thanks.

Thanks also to Nokia and Intel for opening this work, and thanks to Jolla for
continuing to work on it, in the open.

Building / dependencies
=======================

Check the specfile in the 'rpm' directory. Or just use mb2 to build.
